Some feedback on the UI/UX design would be:
 - I would not use blue fade for the status bar.  
 - I have improvised icons for the other states as a tick (even red) would be mixed messaging for a weak password.
 - I have added a light border to the input field as white on white when empty looked odd.

I hope it's ok as this is a test for RN that I have understood the brief and would be able to discuss a feedback to the design team on UX.
